# Cars

The two major files in this project where I wrote the code and test for this are under this:
Cars/src/main/java/Pages/CarsHome.java
Cars/src/main/java/Tests/TestCases.java

For instructions on Selenium setup:
https://www.guru99.com/intellij-selenium-webdriver.html

In order to get this test to work you will need a webdriver

Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Chrome: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
Internet Explorer: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver
Edge: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

This project is set up for firefox, but can easily be modified for the others

Note, in TestCases.java, there are hardcoded address to files listed above, change those to the correct one for local setup
